# **HOLO-VISTA**

HOLO-VISTA is an experimental project aimed at exploring how NFTs can be shared and experienced in a virtual reality environment. This project leverages Solana's Token 22 program for creating and fetching NFTs, with a VR gallery implemented using A-Frame. 

### **Project Overview**

This repository contains a basic implementation of a VR-based NFT gallery. Users can display and interact with their NFTs in a virtual space, offering a different perspective compared to traditional viewing methods. The current version is deployed on GitHub Pages, and you can check it out [here](https://justinfrost47.github.io/nft-gallery-webVR/).

### **Tech Stack**

- **Solana's Token 22 Program**: Used for NFT creation and retrieval.
- **A-Frame**: Provides the framework for building VR scenes in the browser.
- **React**: Frontend library used to manage the UI.
